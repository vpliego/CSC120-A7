Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Which methods did you decide to `overload`, and why?
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?


For the assignment, I decided to 'overload' the constructors for all the subclasses because I was honestly not sure what other methods I'd be able to overload besides the contructors. I was confident in 'overloading' the constructors but I felt like I'd eventually run out of methods to use in order to satisfy the "at least 2" requirement. Furthermore, when working on this assignment, I was confused on how to get started since I wasn't sure how to override the code but once I checked what was in the Building class, I was able to see what needed to be included in order to override the information already provided. That was honestly my process for the entirety of the assignment and it helped me a lot to see what was missing and what needed to be included in order to make it into a parsimonious program. Overall though, it was pretty tricky but I believe I implemented the components needed to make the program work.
